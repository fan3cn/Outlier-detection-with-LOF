# Outlier-detection-with-LOF(Local Outlier Factor)
This is the programming assignment of Data Mining course(course code:CSIT5210/MSBD5002) in CSE, HKUST 2017 Fall.
## Prerequisites
- Python3+
- Numpy
## How to run ?
`python3 lof.py`
## Problem description
Based on the clickstream event frequency pattern in Q2Q3_input.csv, apply LOF algorithm to calculate LOF for each point with the following initial settings:
- Set k = 2 and use Manhattan distance. 
- Set k = 3 and use Euclidean distance.
You need to report top 5 outliers and their lof values for 1 & 2
